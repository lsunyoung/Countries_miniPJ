"Text" = "Travel refers to leaving for another country or region for work, pleasure, or relaxation. It is largely divided into backpacking and package tours, or domestic and overseas trips. In the 2020s, space travel also began to emerge as a new form of travel in earnest.
Civilization has existed since the formation of civilization and the development of navigation and commerce have created loose links between various civilizations and countries. Regardless of the East and West, there has already been a kind of geographical book and tour guide that has written down the ruins, scenic spots, etc. of various places since ancient times, and there have been people who have visited to see it. In the West and the Islamic world, pilgrimage also helped the tourism-travel industry develop. Tourism, which was only a leisure personal entertainment, was accepted from the perspective of today's industry from the 18th to 19th centuries in Europe. Before that, only rich royalty or nobles could go sightseeing, mostly educational tourism. In the 1850s, not only Europe but also colonies were flooded with hotels and resorts similar to today's, coupled with the rapid development of telecommunications and transportation, the emergence of large-scale investment, the stable conditions of Europe with few wars, and the trend of imperialism.
It was also at this time that Gran Turismo, a trip to broaden the horizons of the wealthy in Europe, became sensational, and travel agencies specializing in it sprang up.
As imperialists roamed around the world to develop hotels and resorts, British speculative capital flocked to them, and all kinds of merchants continued to flock to tourist attractions, there were even people who were sick and looking for less crowded places.
As we enter the 21st century, many people continue to show interest in how to use leisure and non-working hours. And scholars are interested in studying how individuals use their leisure time, how effective it is for individuals as well as family members, and how much time and money they spend on trips and vacations that focus on their leisure time. Therefore, the travel industry, such as tourism, is often referred to as a 'caveless industry'.
The reason why travel is becoming more important worldwide is that it is a good means for individuals to lead a free life and improve their quality of life, and for the country to boost the domestic market or earn foreign currency through tourism development. Along with this perception, the demand for travel has increased rapidly as travel has become more convenient due to the development of transportation and the Internet.
Overall, there is a perception of expanding one's knowledge and realizing the meaning of life while experiencing new experiences outside of daily life, and for this reason, it is steadily popular. However, on the other hand, there is also an opinion that this positive perception of travel is somewhat exaggerated and distorted. Travel skeptics argue that traveling does not change life, and that the places tourists visit are tourist-specific places, so they think they have expanded their horizons, but in reality, they only form a distorted image of the area. Some people think that only the positive aspects are highlighted due to the marketing of airlines, travel agencies, and travel-related books, even if they are not this much.
Of course, this is a risk of being exposed to slightly higher risks from free travel or backpacking, and you can look at major tourist attractions, see how locals live, and mix words if you have a chance, but there is also a problem that it is dangerous in terms of security.";
